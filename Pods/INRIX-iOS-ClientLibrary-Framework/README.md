INRIX-iOS-MobileSDK
===================

This repository contains the INRIX iOS SDK, published as a standard Apple Framework. The SDK is available both via CocoaPods and direct Git repo cloning.

The SDK Framework pod is called **INRIX-iOS-ClientLibrary** This pod provides access to INRIX data, including traffic tiles, incidents,
routes, and other types of data.
The Framework is also available in this repository as **IXClientLibrary.framework** and can be added directly to your Xcode project. INRIX recommends using CoacoaPods, however, as deployment and updates are much simpler that way.
